# Day 17 Resources

## Running LLM Locally with Ollama III

![100 days of code Day 17](../../Images/Day17.jpg)

Today, we’ll continue with Part 3 of Running Large Language Models (LLM) Locally with Ollama. Our focus will be on:

**2B and 7B Tuned Models:**

These models refer to large language models that have billions of parameters (2 billion and 7 billion, respectively). They are powerful AI models that can understand and generate human-like text.
We’ll learn how to run these models on your local machine and understand their performance compared to smaller and larger models.
