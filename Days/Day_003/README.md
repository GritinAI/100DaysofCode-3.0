Welcome to Day 3! 
Today, we’ll learn about control flow and data structures and other essential python concepts.

**If Statements:** Control the flow of your program with if, elif, and else statements to handle different conditions.

**While Loops:** Use while loops to repeat code as long as a condition is true.

**Lists:** Lists store multiple items in a single variable. For example, fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].

**List Methods:** Modify lists with methods like append(), remove(), and sort().

**For Loop:** Use for loops to iterate over items in a list or a range of numbers.

**The range() Function:** Generate sequences of numbers with range(), useful for loops.

**Tuples:** Tuples are immutable sequences of items. For example, coordinates = (10, 20).

### Exercise: Practice writing and running Python programs using the concepts you’ve learned.
