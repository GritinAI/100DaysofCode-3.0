Welcome to Day 56 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!


Today we will complete the review of learning Pytorch A. The last 6 hours of the video covers the entire process of working with custom datasets in deep learning, from downloading and exploring the data to building and training a model, and finally predicting on new data. It also covers important concepts like data augmentation, overfitting, and underfitting.
