Welcome to Day 31 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!


Today we will learn about Step-back prompting which is an approach to improve retrieval that builds on chain-of-thought reasoning. From a question, it generates a step-back (higher level, more abstract) question that can serve as a precondition to correctly answering the original question. This is especially useful in cases where background knowledge or more fundamental understanding is helpful to answer a specific question.
