Welcome to Day 63 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!
  
Autoencoders are trained to minimize the difference between the input data and the reconstructed output, typically using a loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy.   
Today, we will introduce Autoencoders, how they work and how we can implement them in PyTorch.
