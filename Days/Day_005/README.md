 Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on data to identify patterns and make informed decisions.
 
**ML in Action:** Machine Learning can be applied in various areas like recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix), image recognition (e.g., Google Photos), and predictive analytics (e.g., stock market forecasts).

**Jupyter Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment that allows you to write and run Python code, visualize data, and document your work. Itâ€™s widely used for data analysis and machine learning projects.
