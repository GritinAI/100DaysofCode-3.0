Welcome to Day 6! Today, we’ll focus on how to approach a real machine learning problem.

### How to Approach a Real Machine Learning Problem:

Define the Problem: Clearly understand the problem you’re trying to solve. Define the goals and objectives.

Collect and Prepare Data: Gather relevant data and preprocess it by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Choose a Model: Select a suitable machine learning model based on the problem. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

Train the Model: Use the training data to teach the model how to make predictions.

Evaluate the Model: Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall help assess how well the model performs.

Improve the Model: Based on the evaluation, make adjustments to improve the model’s performance.

Deploy and Monitor: Once satisfied with the model, deploy it to make real-time predictions and monitor its performance over time.
