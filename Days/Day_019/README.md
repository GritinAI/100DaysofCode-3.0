# Day 19 Resources

## Running Gemma with Hugging Face, Ollama, and Exploring LangChain

![100 days of code Day 19](../../Images/Day19.png)

Today, we’ll be focusing on two powerful tools for running and managing AI models:

**Running Gemma Using Hugging Face and Ollama:**
Gemma is an advanced AI model designed for natural language understanding and generation. We’ll learn how to efficiently run this model using both the Hugging Face platform and Ollama, enabling more effective use of generative AI technologies.
