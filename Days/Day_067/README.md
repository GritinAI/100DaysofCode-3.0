## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Welcome to Day 67 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!


We have learnt that Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of autoencoder that learns a probabilistic representation of the input data. They are trained to maximize the likelihood of the data while also regularizing the latent space to follow a Gaussian distribution. Today we will rewatch the video and place more emphasis on how to define latent variable space.
